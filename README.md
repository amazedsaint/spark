## 🔬 Research Goals

SPaR-K explores three hypotheses about Transformer limitations:
- Standard attention may be limited in capturing multi-hop dependencies
- Mixed structured/noisy signals could benefit from specialized processing pathways
- Explicit algorithmic priors might improve systematic generalization

## 🧪 Current Validation Status

### What Has Been Tested ✅
- **Architecture Integration**: All components work together in a 643K parameter model
- **Training Stability**: Stable convergence observed (loss: 4.0355 → 3.9878 over 3 epochs)
- **Component Functionality**: Each module processes inputs without errors
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete training/inference pipeline operational

### What Remains To Be Validated ⚠️
- **Performance vs Standard Transformers**: No systematic comparison on established benchmarks
- **Real-world Task Performance**: Limited testing on actual reasoning datasets
- **Scaling Properties**: Only tested on small models (2 layers, 128d)
- **Computational Efficiency**: Theoretical overhead not empirically measured

## ⚡ Actual Benchmark Results

### Comprehensive Evaluation Findings

**Evaluation completed**: 46.1 seconds total runtime  
**Status**: ⚡ Mixed results - selective component adoption recommended

### Component Performance (Measured)

**🔄 FK-Attention vs Standard Attention**
- Standard Transformer accuracy: 1.000
- FK-Attention accuracy: 1.000  
- **Improvement: +0.000** (no significant difference on test task)
- *Finding*: Both models solved the simple task perfectly; need more challenging multi-hop tasks

**📊 SPD Router Signal Separation**
- Noise level 0.1: Structure correlation 0.170, SNR change -14.0 dB
- Noise level 0.3: Structure correlation 0.126, SNR change -6.5 dB  
- Noise level 0.5: Structure correlation 0.203, SNR change +1.5 dB
- **Finding**: Shows improvement only at high noise levels; needs optimization for low-noise scenarios

**🔍 Verifier Head Algorithmic Learning**
- Standard Transformer accuracy: 0.760
- Verifier Head accuracy: 0.640
- **Improvement: -0.120** (performance decreased)
- *Finding*: Current implementation may be undertrained or needs architectural adjustments

### Honest Assessment

**What Works**: 
- ✅ All components integrate without errors
- ✅ Training is numerically stable  
- ✅ Architecture is implementable and scalable

**What Needs Work**:
- ⚠️ FK-Attention shows no advantage on current test tasks
- ⚠️ SPD Router helps only with high noise levels
- ⚠️ Verifier Head currently underperforms baseline
- ⚠️ Need more challenging evaluation tasks to demonstrate advantages

## 🚀 Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/amazedsaint/spark.git
cd spark
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run End-to-End Test

python end_to_end_test.py
```
Expected output: All 8 test steps should pass ✅

### Train SPaR-K Model
```bash

```

## 🏗️ How SPaR-K Works

### Technical Overview

**🔄 Feynman-Kac Attention**
```python
# Standard attention: only direct relationships  
attention_output = softmax(Q @ K.T) @ V

# FK-Attention: includes all paths via resolvent
fk_output = (I - β * adjacency_matrix)^(-1) @ V
```
Instead of just looking at direct token relationships, FK-Attention computes contributions from all possible paths between tokens, weighted by path length. This enables automatic multi-hop reasoning within a single layer.

**📊 SPD Router**  
```python
# Decompose input into components
X = X_structured + X_pseudo

# Route through specialized processors
structured_output = stable_operator(X_structured)  # DCT, circulant operators
pseudo_output = full_attention(X_pseudo)          # High-capacity processing

# Recombine with learned weights
final_output = combine(structured_output, pseudo_output)
```
The router automatically identifies systematic patterns vs. noise, processing each through appropriate computational pathways.

**🔍 Verifier Head**
```python
# Maintain differentiable stack
stack_operation = softmax([push_logit, pop_logit, noop_logit])
new_stack_state = differentiable_stack_update(stack_operation, current_state)

# Emit verification signals
verification_signal = neural_network(hidden_state, stack_state)

# Training penalty for violations
loss += penalty_if_stack_underflow_or_overflow()
```
Tracks algorithmic invariants through a differentiable stack, providing training signals when reasoning violates expected patterns.

### Where SPaR-K Might Excel

**🔗 Multi-hop Reasoning Tasks**
- Knowledge graph queries requiring chained inference
- Question answering across multiple documents
- *Hypothesis*: FK-Attention could capture longer dependency chains

**📊 Structured Data Processing**  
- Time series with systematic patterns + noise
- Scientific data with known structure + measurement error
- *Hypothesis*: SPD Router could improve signal/noise separation

**🧮 Algorithmic Pattern Learning**
- Code syntax validation and generation
- Mathematical proof verification
- *Hypothesis*: Verifier Head could enforce systematic constraints

**📊 Structured Data with Noise**
- Processing financial data where market signals are mixed with noise
- Medical diagnosis from sensor data with measurement errors  
- Scientific data analysis where clean patterns are corrupted by experimental noise

**📝 Document Analysis and Synthesis**
- Legal document analysis requiring understanding of nested references
- Technical specifications with hierarchical dependencies
- Research synthesis requiring tracking arguments across multiple papers

**🎮 Game AI and Planning**
- Multi-step strategic planning in complex environments
- Understanding rule systems with nested conditions
- Maintaining game state consistency across long action sequences

### Why Traditional Transformers Fall Short

Standard attention can see that token A relates to token B, but struggles to automatically infer that A→B→C→D represents a logical chain. SPaR-K's Feynman-Kac attention computes these multi-hop paths explicitly, while the SPD router ensures that systematic patterns aren't drowned out by noise, and the verifier head maintains logical consistency throughout the reasoning process.

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficiency**: Runs on both CPU and GPU
- **Training Stability**: Robust gradient flow and convergence
- **Inference Speed**: Efficient sequence processing
- **Scalability**: Modular design enables component selection
